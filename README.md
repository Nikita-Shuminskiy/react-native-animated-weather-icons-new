### Changes since forking:
* Created a single component to use rather than having to import each different component in. Now the name can be passed into said singular component.
* Fixed an issue with snow icon not working due to path errors.
* Some other react-native issues that were causing errors.

### Possible future changes:
* Specifying styles and colors
* Allowing options for animation looping, pausing, etc.
